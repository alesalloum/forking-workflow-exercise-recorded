Finnish Salmon Tacos

Salmon taco ingredients

    Salmon – Fresh, buttery, flaky salmon is naturally mild tasting, meaning it pairs well with the savory and smoky seasonings in this fish taco recipe. I prefer using fresh salmon fillets, but you can also use frozen. Just make sure the fillets are completely thawed and patted dry before cooking.
    Seasonings – A simple mix of chili powder, ancho chili powder, garlic powder, and onion powder gives the pan fried salmon a slightly spicy, smoky, and aromatic flavor profile.
    Tortillas – You can use either corn tortillas or flour tortillas for these salmon tacos. Homemade tortillas are easy to make but you can always use store bought to speed things up.
    Toppings – Salmon tacos are refreshing and bright in summer, so I like to top them with crunchy and creamy fish taco slaw, then finish them off with fresh cilantro, sliced radishes, and lime wedges for extra brightness.
